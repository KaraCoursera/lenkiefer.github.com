<p>WE ARE ONE MONTH INTO 2017 AND WITH THIS MONTH’S economic releases we’ve completed most of the picture of 2016. These data by and large matched our expectations as I <a href="../../../../chartbooks/dec2016/index.html">outlined in my 2016 year-in-review</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look.</p>

<h1>Existing homes sales best in a decade</h1>
<p>Last week the National Association of Realtors (NAR) <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/news-releases/2017/01/existing-home-sales-slide-in-december-2016-sales-best-since-2006">reported</a> on existing home sales for December of 2016. On a seasonally adjusted basis home sales declined 2.8 percent from November’s pace. Despite the fact that home sales slowed in December home sales finished their best year in a decade. Lack of inventory on increased mortgage interest rates contributed to the slowdown in existing home sales.</p>
<p>Nevertheless existing home sales for 2016 outpaced the past 9 years:</p>

<h3>New home sales low by historical standards</h3>
<p>On Thursday of last week, the U.S. Census Bureau and HUD <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf">reported</a> on new home sales for December 2016. New home sales also dipped a bit in December, though the month-to-month change was not statistically significant. However, sales are still well below the levels we saw last decade, even before the housing boom.</p>
<p>The graph below shows the trend in monthly new home sales, and has a shaded region to account for uncertainty in the monthly estimates.</p>
