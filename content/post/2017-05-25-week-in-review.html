<p>QUITE A LOT OF HOUSING DATA CAME OUT THIS WEEK. Let’s recap with some graphs.</p>
<div id="mortgage-rates-back-below-4-percent" class="section level1">
<h1>Mortgage rates back below 4 percent</h1>
<p>The 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell back below 4 percent <a href="http://freddiemac.mwnewsroom.com/press-releases/mortgage-rates-drop-to-lowest-of-2017-otcqb-fmcc-1310392">this week</a>.</p>

</div>
<div id="new-home-sales" class="section level1">
<h1>New home sales</h1>
<p>New home sales data <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html">was released</a> and came in weaker than expected for April 2017. March has been an extremely strong number, so a decline was anticipated, but the drop was bigger than most expected.</p>

<p>Despite the drop in April, new home sales are trending higher over the long run; the year-to-date sum of monthly sales was up 11.3% (+/- 6.7%). But it remains a long road back to recovery for new home sales.</p>

<div id="existing-home-sales-on-pace-for-best-year-in-a-decade" class="section level1">
<h1>Existing home sales on pace for best year in a decade</h1>
<p>Existing home sales data were <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/topics/existing-home-sales">also released</a>. And like new home sales, existing home sales declined. However, the first four months of 2017 are the best year-to-date total for existing home sales since 2007.</p>

<div id="house-prices" class="section level2">
<h2>House prices</h2>
<p>The FHFA <a href="https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/pages/house-price-index.aspx">released</a> updated house prices through the first quarter of 2017. House price growth remains strong, rising 6.0 percent from the first quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2017.</p>
<p>They also released quarterly data on state house price trends. The plot below compares the four-quarter percentage change in house prices by state.</p>

<p>We can use <a href="https://github.com/hafen/geofacet">geofacet</a> like we did <a href="../../../../2017/05/22/geo-my-facet">earlier this month</a> to try an alternate layout for the plot. The plot below focuses on the four-quarter percent change in house prices since 2005. It’s the same data as above, just arranged differently.</p>

<div id="coming-soon" class="section level1">
<h1>Coming soon</h1>
<p>It’s about time to update my hairball.</p>
<p>The Census <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/cb17-81-population-estimates-subcounty.html">released</a> updated population and housing unit estimates. We can use that data to update some analysis we did <a href="../../../../2016/03/30/real-house-prices-and-population-growth">last year</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll get you the updated analysis and code sometime soon. In the meanwhile, here’s a plot we’ll be exploring and explaining. It should make at least 5 percent more sense after we talk about it!</p>
