<p>THE YEAR IS DRAWING TO A CLOSE and by many measures 2016 was the best year for housing in a decade. Back in <a href="../../../../chartbooks/may2016/index.html">May</a> I shared some trends on housing markets in a <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html">Tufte style document</a>. Now that we have nearly a full year’s worth of data, let’s see how housing and mortgage markets did in 2016.</p>
<p>Well, I’ve created a retrospective looking back at the full year. You can read it <a href="../../../../chartbooks/dec2016/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Check it out and let me know what you think.</p>
