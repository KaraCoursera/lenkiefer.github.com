<p>IN THIS POST I AM GOING TO share a couple gifs displaying mortgage rate trends. Check my earlier posts <a href="../../../../2016/12/08/10-ways-to-visualize-rates">here</a> and <a href="../../../../2016/12/12/ribbon-rate-chart">here</a> for other charts.</p>
<p>I don’t have time tonight to write up all the code for these, so I’m just sharing the images. Check back later (message/<a href="https://twitter.com/lenkiefer">tweet at me</a>) if you’d like to see the code.</p>
<div id="standard-time-series" class="section level1">
<h1>Standard time series</h1>
<p>First we have our standard time series gif, updated through December 15, 2016:</p>

</div>
<div id="compare-weekly-rates" class="section level1">
<h1>Compare weekly rates</h1>
<p>Another way I like to visualize rates is to look at rates by week of year.</p>
<p>Instead of using date for the x axis, we use the week of the year and plot a separate line for recent years (2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016). By comparing the lines at any point on the x axis, we can see where rates were one or more years ago on this week.</p>

</div>
<div id="distribution-of-rates-by-year" class="section level1">
<h1>Distribution of rates by year</h1>
<p>Next I wanted to look at the distribution of weekly rates by year:</p>

</div>
<div id="falling-time-falling-rates" class="section level1">
<h1>Falling time, falling rates</h1>
<p>I was feeling a little more emotional about rates, so I put together this whimsical graph that puts time on the vertical axis flowing down. I also made it so that the alpha transparency fades and the line thickness diminished. I wanted to capture the feeling of ink brush painting.</p>

</div>
<div id="horizontal-rates" class="section level1">
<h1>Horizontal rates</h1>
<p>This was an alternative of the above, with a more traditional left-to-right time orientation.</p>
