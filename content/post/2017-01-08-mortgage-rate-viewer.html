<p>IN THE PAST I HAVE USED MANY DIFFERENT programs to visualize data. I’ve <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/leonard.kiefer#!/">done quite a few visualizations</a> using <a href="http://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>. I enjoy using that program, but it does have some drawbacks.</p>
<p>As an alternative, I have been exploring using <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">flexdashboards</a> for <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. One advantage of flexdashboards is that you can easily incorporate R code into the design of dashboards.</p>
<p>I figured I would give it a try. The example below, uses mortgage rates. I used <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/">DT</a> to make interactive data tables and <a href="https://plot.ly/r/">Plotly for R</a> to make interactive times series charts. I also used <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/index.html">stargazer</a> to make nicely formatted regression output.</p>
<p>All the source code is available in the tab at the right. I used a simple excel spreadsheet called “rates.xlsx”, which you can download from the <a href="../../../../chartbooks/jan2017/rates.xlsx">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can see a fullscreen version <a href="../../../../chartbooks/jan2017/mortgage_rate_viewer_jan_2017.html">here</a>.</p>
