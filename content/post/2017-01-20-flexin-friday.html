<p>WE WORKED OUT A <a href="http://lenkiefer.com/2017/01/18/workin-workout">VISUALIZATION REMIX ON WEDNESDAY</a> and now that it’s Friday time to flex a little. In this post I’m going to remix the remix into a <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html">flexdashboard</a>.</p>
<p>I made this dashboard using <a href="http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/">crosstalk</a> and <a href="https://plot.ly/r/">plotly</a>. By using <a href="http://www.htmlwidgets.org/">htmlwidgets</a> we can create an interactive dashboard in a static webpage.</p>
<p>In this version I added an animation. In order to get <a href="https://cpsievert.github.io/plotly_book/key-frame-animations.html">the animation to work</a> you’ll need the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/plotly">development version of plotly</a> for R.</p>
<p>It took me a while to get the animation to work, but basically I combined a <a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a> graph with plotly using <a href="https://plot.ly/ggplot2/">ggplotly</a>. ggplotly doesn’t support all features of ggplot2, for example rug plots are out, but it does quite a lot. I’m fond of thinking if you can make a scatterplot along with line segments and polygons, you basically can create any visualization you want (<em>you might also need curves if you believe in them</em>).</p>
