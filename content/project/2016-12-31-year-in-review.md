THE YEAR IS DRAWING TO A CLOSE and by many measures 2016 was the best year for housing in a decade. Back in [May](../../page/may2016/) I shared some trends on housing markets in a [Tufte style document](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html).  Now that we have nearly a full year's worth of data, let's see how housing and mortgage markets did in 2016.

Well, I've created a retrospective looking back at the full year.  You can read it [here](../../page/dec2016/).

Check it out and let me know what you think.
