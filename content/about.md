Hi, my name is Len Kiefer and I help people understand the economy, housing, and mortgage markets.

_This is a personal site. The opinions expressed here represent my own and not those of my employer._

I'm a PhD economist working at a Financial Services firm in Northern Virginia. My academic training focused on Macroeconomics and Econometrics, but these days I spend a lot of time on issues related to housing and mortgage finance.

When I'm not working or tinkering with code over here, I spend time with my wife and  two kids. I'm trying to raise them right and teach them to root for the Ohio State University Buckeyes and the University of Kentucky Wildcats (my alma maters). We play basketball on the youth rim in the driveway. We got a deal, I let them win at HORSE and they cheer for my slam dunks on the 7 foot rim.

I also like to spend time working trying to become a better communicator. That means better writing, better speaking (I do a lot of talking through my work) and better data visualization. In this blog I'll talk about some of those things and share what I figure out.  

It's an exciting time to be working in these areas.  There are a lot of great tools that make things much easier and open up all sorts of possibilities. We'll try some of them out here. And there's a lot of smart people who have really helped me get up to speed. Some of them I've been fortunate to meet (either in person or over social media, primarily Twitter and LinkedIn). Maybe I can pay it forward and help you out.
